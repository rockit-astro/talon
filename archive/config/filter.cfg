! Details about the filter wheel motor
IAXIS		0		! csimc addr

IUSESCRIPT	0		! 1 if using script-based indexing
ISBIGFILTER	0		! 1 to use an SBIG filter wheel
ISCRIPTTO	20		! Timeout in seconds for script timeout
IHASLIM		0		! 1 if this axis uses limit switches, else 0.
IPOSSIDE	0		! 1 to use the cw side of home sw, else 0
IHOMELOW	1		! 1 if home switch is active low, else 0
ISTEP		80000		! usteps per full revolution (or tray travel)
ISIGN		1		! 1 if raw pos moves cw, -1 if ccw

! Details about each filter. Each entry consists of up to 5 fields, separated
! by commas (,) as follows, (each also lists a default if missing):
!
!   Name, must begin with a unique letter, case is ignored (required)
!   flat calibration time, seconds (FLATDURDEF)
!   flat light source intensity, 1..3	(FLATLTEDEF)
!   focus setting 1 as "microns_from_home/temperature_C" (NOMPOSDEF/FILTTDEF)
!   focus setting 2 as "microns_from_home/temperature_C" (setting 1)
!

FLATDURDEF	5			! default flat duration, secs
FLATLTEDEF      1			! default flat illumination level, 1..3
FILTTDEF	20			! default temperature, C

FILT0		'Empty'			! Update 28 Feb  2008
NFILT		1			! total number of filter positions
FDEFLT		'Empty'                 ! default filter after homing

! N.B. Even if IHAVE is set to 0, FDEFLT must still be defined and will be
! used to store flat and focus info. FILT* and NFILT must also be sensible.
