This is a simple FITS viewer.
It only supports FITS files with SIMPLE=T, BITPIX=16 and NAXSi(i>2)==1.

How to do absolute photometry:

1) bring up photometry feature with Options->Enable Photometry features
2) change to Absolute mode by clicking on "Absolute Photometry"
3) define a reference star by clicking on "(Re)Define Reference..."
4) enter true BVRI for a reference star in spaces provided and click "Apply".
5) establish instrument corrections by bringing up images of the reference
   star in each color. Turn on "Define Intrs Cor" and click on the star with the
   right mouse button; you will see the "Instr Cor" column get filled in based
   on the filter used to make the image. When instrument corrections have been
   established for all colors (or those colors desired) turn "Define Instr Cor"
   back off.
6) bring up any image, click on any star. Its magnitude will be displayed in
   the "Mag" column at the row which corresponds to the Filter field of the
   image (if any). The value shown will always be corrected for distinction.
   If the B and V instrument corrections were established for the reference
   star then the value shown will be also be fully color corrected and a Y
   will appear in the "B-V Cor" column; if B or V instrument corrections are
   not known then the value will only be corrected for distinction and a "N"
   will appear.
7) The RA and Dec values for each star measured are saved so that the same
   star can be visited on several images to accumulate all BVRI values. The
   list of locations grows forever unless cleared with by clicking on "Reset
   Star List".
