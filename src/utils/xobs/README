xobs allows direct GUI control of the telescope, focus, filter wheel,
dome and shutter. It also offers several special purpose functions to assist
in initial telescope setup such as axis calibration and focusing and runtime
features such as catalog access and a software paddle. For all its features,
xobs is really just a wrapper for the real work to be performed by the daemons.
