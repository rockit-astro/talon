gscload can read an ASP GSC CDROM and save it to a local disk cache or print
GSC stars around any region.

This program loads any region of the sky from CDROM to disk as specified
by the required arguments of RA, Dec, FOV and Mag. Or, it can print all stars
in that region.

To load the entire northern CDROM to disk, use:

    gscload 0 90 194 20

To load the entire southern CDROM to disk, use:

    gscload 0 -90 164 20

The northern disk occupies approximately 86 MB, the southern about 73 MB.
