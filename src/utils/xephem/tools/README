Here are several scripts to convert various catalog files into xephem
format. Contact the author if you need one or have one.

tle2edb.pl is a perl script for converting the NASA "2-line" earth satellite
format into XEphem format; see the Help on Credits from the Main menu for how
to get timely shuttle and Space Station elements in this format.

jost2edb.awk is for converting the elements that are included near the end of
occasional comets ephemerides posted to sci.astro by Jost Jahn.

encke2edb.pl is helpful when cracking ephemerides posted on
http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov.

mpcorb2edb.pl is a perl script to convert the file of asteroid elements 
updated daily by the Minor Planet Center. Actually, the script generates two
files: those which can ever get brighter than a certain limit, and all others.
Run with -f and it even ftp's and explodes the correct file for you first.

astorb2edb.pl does much the same, but for the Lowell database. See
ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.html. Run with -f and it even ftp's and
explodes the correct file for you first.

mpccomets.pl is a perl script to convert the file of comet elements at
http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/Soft00Cmt.txt to .edb
format. Like mpcorb2edb, it actually generates two files.

extract.awk is an interesting script which tries to figure out the format
of a comet posting on usenet and convert whatever it finds to xephem format.
