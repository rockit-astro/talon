What is this:

lx200xed is a daemon to connect XEphem to a Meade LX200 on a serial port. It
connects between the serial port into which the telescope is plugged and
XEphem by using its two fifos xephem_in_fifo and xephem_loc_fifo. XEphem
expects to find these fifos in its ShareDir resource directory. lx200xed is
told where they are with its -m and -g command line options. It is told which
serial port to use with its -t option. Neither program creates the fifos; 
they must be created ahead of time using mkfifo(1). XEphem does not start
the lx200xed daemon, you must do that before activating the Telescope controls
in the Sky View.

Using ASCII art it works like this:

   -----------                                                   ----------
  |  XEphem   | ---> /usr/local/xephem/fifos/xephem_loc_fifo -> |          |
  | Sky View  |                                                 | lx200xed |
  |           | <--- /usr/local/xephem/fifos/xephem_in_fifo <-  |          |
   -----------                                                   ----------
                                                                     |
								     |
								     v
                                                                 /dev/ttyS0
