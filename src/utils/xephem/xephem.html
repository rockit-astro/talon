<H2>Description</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program
       for X Windows systems with Motif. It provides many
       graphical views as well as quantitative heliocentric,
       geocentric and topocentric information for Earth
       satellites, solar system and celestial objects.

       <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> contains extensive context-sensitive on-line help.
       Virtually none of that help is duplicated here so go ahead
       and run <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> to learn more.

       The <EM>Main</EM> <EM>window</EM> of <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> provides control and display of
       three basic services: observing circumstances, looping,
       and access to additional displays. Observing circumstances
       includes location, date, time and atmospheric conditions
       (used for the refraction model). Looping refers to the
       ability to set up <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> so that it automatically
       increments time at a desired step size and rate.
       Additional displays provide all of the graphical and
       quantitative information available, and always refer to
       the circumstances defined in the main menu.



</PRE>
<H2>Options</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>-prfb</STRONG> displays all the built-in default resources then
       exits.

       <STRONG>-install</STRONG> controls whether <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> will install a private
       colormap. Without this option <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> will try to decide
       automatically whether it is necessary. To force using a
       private colormap, use <EM>-install</EM> <EM>yes;</EM> to prevent it use
       <EM>-install</EM> <EM>no.</EM>  The default automatic behavior is equivalent
       to <EM>-install</EM> <EM>guess.</EM>



</PRE>
<H2>Menu Tour</H2><PRE>
       <EM>File</EM>

       This menu controls basic operation, including exiting.
       When <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> is first started it may beep. This means a
       message has been put in the <STRONG>messages</STRONG> dialog, which can be
       displayed from this menu. Other chores here include
       setting up network access; defining Field Stars;
       displaying a simple progress meter; and controlling time
       and location information remotely.

       <EM>View</EM>
       Moon and several planets; a user configurable table
       displaying; and Sky and Solar System views.

       <EM>Tools</EM>

       This menu gives access to tools which can plot any <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG>
       data items; save any data items to text files for easy
       export to other programs; and with which the user may
       enter an arbitrary function to compute using any <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG>
       data items and solve for specialized circumstances.

       <EM>Objects</EM>

       This menu gives control over which objects <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> will
       work with.  Objects may be created on the fly, read from
       catalog file, deleted or searched. A special category of
       objects known as <EM>Field</EM> <EM>Stars</EM> may be configured, which are
       very large catalogs of objects whose access has been
       optimized. Up to three User objects may be assigned for
       especially easy access in several other places throughout
       <STRONG>XEphem.</STRONG>  Also here is a tool with which to find all pairs
       of objects with less than a specified separation.

       <EM>Preferences</EM>

       This menu offers several configuration choices. These will
       effect the overall computation, appearance or behavior of
       <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> over all.

       <EM>Help</EM>

       This menu offers overall information about B .XEphem, plus
       several worked examples.  Also included are references,
       version number and the Copyright statement.  These
       additional displays are activated from the <EM>Views</EM> pulldown.



</PRE>
<H2>X Resources</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> initial conditions are defined using X resources,
       some of which you will soon want to tune to your taste and
       circumstances; many others may be left unchanged.  Look
       through the comments in the default <EM>XEphem</EM> resource file
       details.  In accord with standard X Windows procedure,
       this file may be located in the directories named by the
       <STRONG>XUSERFILESEARCHPATH</STRONG> or <STRONG>XFILESEARCHPATH</STRONG> environment
       variables. It may also be located in a directory named
       <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> in the users $HOME directory.

       Of course, in addition to all the custom resources, <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG>
       supports the usual Xt command line arguments such as
       -display, -xrm, -synchronous, -fg and -bg.

       <STRONG>XEphem</STRONG> will attempt to support time zone control
       information from the host operating system.  If this fails
       for some reason, time zone offset and name may also be set
       manually at any time from the Main menu, or they may be
       initialized from the XEphem.TZName and XEphem.TZone
       resources, respectively.
