       XXEEpphheemm is an interactive astronomical ephemeris program
       for X Windows systems with Motif. It provides many
       graphical views as well as quantitative heliocentric,
       geocentric and topocentric information for Earth
       satellites, solar system and celestial objects.

       XXEEpphheemm contains extensive context-sensitive on-line help.
       Virtually none of that help is duplicated here so go ahead
       and run XXEEpphheemm to learn more.

       The _M_a_i_n _w_i_n_d_o_w of XXEEpphheemm provides control and display of
       three basic services: observing circumstances, looping,
       and access to additional tools and displays. Observing
       circumstances includes location, date, time and
       atmospheric conditions (used for the refraction model).
       Looping refers to the ability to set up XXEEpphheemm so that it
       automatically increments time at a desired step size and
       rate. Additional displays provide all of the graphical and
       quantitative information available, and always refer to
       the circumstances defined in the main menu. Tools provide
       access to plotting, searching, AAVSO, Seti@Home and more.


OOppttiioonnss
       --pprrffbb displays all the built-in default resources, then
       exits.

       --iinnssttaallll controls whether XXEEpphheemm will install a private
       colormap. Without this option XXEEpphheemm will try to decide
       automatically whether it is necessary. To force using a
       private colormap, use _-_i_n_s_t_a_l_l _y_e_s_; to prevent it use
       _-_i_n_s_t_a_l_l _n_o_.  The default automatic behavior is equivalent
       to _-_i_n_s_t_a_l_l _g_u_e_s_s_.

       _F_i_l_e

       This menu controls basic operation, including exiting.
       When XXEEpphheemm is first started it may beep. This means a
       message has been put in the mmeessssaaggeess dialog, which can be
       displayed from this menu. Other chores here include
       setting up network access; a simple progress meter;
       controlling time and location information remotely.

                                                                1





XEphem(1X)                                             XEphem(1X)


       This menu offers several graphical displays if the Earth,
       Moon and several planets; a user configurable table; and
       Sky and Solar System views.

       _T_o_o_l_s

       This menu gives access to tools which can plot any XXEEpphheemm
       data items; save any data items to text files for easy
       export to other programs; enter an arbitrary function to
       evaluate and solve using any XXEEpphheemm data items; access
       AAVSO online; monitor your Seti@Home client; show the
       Night at a glance; and find close pairs of objects.

       _D_a_t_a

       This menu gives control over which objects XXEEpphheemm will
       work with.  Objects may be created on the fly, read from
       catalog files, deleted or searched. A special category of
       objects known as _F_i_e_l_d _S_t_a_r_s may be configured, which are
       very large catalogs of objects whose access has been
       optimized. Up to three User objects may be assigned for
       especially easy access in several other places throughout
       XXEEpphheemm..  Also here is a tool which can update Earth
       satellite orbital elements from the web.

       _P_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s

       This menu offers several configuration choices. These will
       effect the overall appearance or behavior of XXEEpphheemm..
       These choices, as well as fonts and colors, can be changed
       at runtime and saved to disk to become the new defaults.

       _H_e_l_p

       This menu offers overall information about B .XEphem;
       context sensitive help; several worked examples;
       references; version number and the Copyright statement.


XX RReessoouurrcceess
       XXEEpphheemm initial conditions are defined using a resource
       file. By default the file is named XEphem located in a
       directory also called XEphem in your $HOME directory. You
       should never find the need to edit this by hand because
       XXEEpphheemm will manage it when you Save settings.
