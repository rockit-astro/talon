"prop" is an exerciser program that simply runs the sgp4/sdp4 as
appropriate for some hundred points in time on every TLE that you feed it
on stdin.  It doesn't output much.

"prop2" is the program that propagates one element set and compares the
results with propagations of future and past element sets.
Try e g 

    prop2 test.tle ref.tle

and watch the output.  All TLEs in the ref.tle file are for the same
satellite, but different epochs.
