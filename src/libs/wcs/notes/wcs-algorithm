How does the wcs algorithm work?
--------------------------------

The program
   tools/wcs/wcs.c
is wcs as called from command line.

The file
   GUI/camera/wcs.c
contains a function to compute wcs solutions when called from camera.

Both the above use
   setWCSFITS (in libwcs/setwcsfits.c)

i.e. setwcsfits is essentially the function that searches for wcs solutions.
