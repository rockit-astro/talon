Top level (command line) program:  tools/wcs/wcs.c

Top level program calls setWCSFITS

The camera version GUI/camera/wcs.c also calls setWCSFITS

setWCSFITS:  identify image stars from fits file, then call spiralToFit

spiralToFit:  true location of image in sky is unknown; so start from an
   initially guessed location (RA,dec) and see if it can be matched to the
   image; continue trying locations, spiralling outwards from the initially
   guessed location, to try to find a match; at each location, call tryOneLoc

tryOneLoc:  extract (from online catalogue database) catalogue stars centred
   on the location where you're currently searching for a match; call
   findRegistration to see if image and catalogue stars can be matched, thus
   determining a 5-parameter WCS solution

findRegistration:  use similar triangle method to search for match; new
   version to use distance method
