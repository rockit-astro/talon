gsc.c is the source to GSCSetup() and GSCFetch() which are functions to setup
for and read the STScI GSC V1.1 CDROM and return subsets of stars near any
direction. The function can also make local compressed cache disk files and use
them from then on if present.

usno.c is the source to USNOSetup() and USNOFetch() which are functions to
setup for and read the USNO SA1.0 or other compatable CDROMs and return subsets
of stars near any direction.

For test, a complete program, sadump, accepts RA/Dec/FOV on the command line and
prints the SA?.0 fields in said region to stdout in .edb format.
