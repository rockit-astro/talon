Vendor-supplied driver for Finger Lakes Instrument cameras.
New versions of the driver should be extracted here.

-----------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: (STO) April 2009
The libfli-RBI-prerelease directory added here is an updated
but not yet public version of the FLI distribution.  This was
obtained from Jim Moronski of FLI, and aside from a few trivial
edits for compile compatibility, is unmodified.

To enable the RBI Annihilation feature (which has conditional 
support added to the libmisc/ccdcamera API to support this on
FLI with the new library), you will need to rename the existing
libfli directory (i.e. libfli-release-1.71) and then rename 
the libfli-RBI-prerelease folder to libfli.  Then rebuild.

Note that if you do this, the SVN folder names will be out of
synch.  This is ONLY A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. 

More permanently, we should replace the existing libfli with
this RBI version (assuming it passes the tests of time), and/or
replace libfli with an equivalent public release when it is
available.

At such time that a more permanent solution is found, please
remove the legacy directories and this note from the SVN
tree.

UPDATED NOTE: (STO) December 2009
With this version, the RBI "prerelease" library is now 
used by default, the names of the distribution directories
are updated in SVN and the nominal "libfli" directory is
now a soft link built by the Makefile.
This update notwithstanding, the previous advisory to be
on the lookout for an "official" RBI Linux update distro
and the future disposition of this build solution still stands.
