telescoped: telescope control daemon.
For use with CSIMC.

Uses the following fifo pairs (.in and .out suffix are wrt us):

	Tel.{in,out}
	Filter.{in,out}
	Focus.{in,out}
	Dome.{in,out}
	Lights.{in,out}
	Powerfail.{in,out}

Uses the csimcd daemon to control the stepper motors:

	$(TELHOME)/bin/csimcd

Assumes these functions are already loaded on the CSIMC:

    /* find home in pos/neg direction, according to $way = +/-1.
     * bounces off limits during search.
     * prints progress messages prefixed with 1:, errors with -1:, done with 0:.
     * N.B. assumes ipolar, homebit, plimbit and nlimbit were set up prior.
     */
    define findhome($way)

    /* find and report encoder position of limit, according to $way = +/-1
     * N.B. assumes ipolar, plimbit and nlimbit were set up prior.
     */
    define findlim($way)

    /* report current clock, mpos, mvel, epos and ilevel */
    define report()

Reads parameters from:

	telescoped.cfg
	focus.cfg
	telsched.cfg
	dome.cfg

Reads parameters from and makes updates to:

	home.cfg
	filter.cfg

"Canonical" directions are used throughout to eliminate the need to know
the signs of the actual motors. If the latter are referred to, they
are called "raw" directions. The canonical conventions are as follows:

    HA(Az):	+ccw looking down at scope from North (above) (like RA, not HA)
    Dec(Alt):	+moving towards scope's pole (like Dec)
    Field:	+cw rotation, looking "through" the camera
    Focus:	+moving to shorten the optical path from primary to camera
    Filter:	+cw rotation, looking "through" the camera
    Dome:	+cw looking down from above
